<p><em>Copy URL With Hash</em> is a Firefox add-on to copy a page's URL with a hash at the end that identifies the location on the page.</p>

<h2 id="HowItWorks">How It Works</h2>
<p>When building a web page, web developers can assign an ID to a specific element on a page. Then, they can use the ID to link directly to that element on the page. For example, Wikipedia pages have a Table of Contents; the links inside the Table of Contents take you to different parts of the same page. When you <span class="filter_desktop">click</span><span class="filter_filler"> or </span><span class="filter_mobile">tap</span> on an item in the Table of Contents, look at the URL in the location bar; the section of the page is identified in the URL by the <code>hash</code> (the part of the URL after the hashtag symbol: <code>#</code>).</p>
<p>Some sites provide an easy way to get a link to a specific part of the page; for example, on Wikipedia, you can <span class="filter_desktop">right-click</span><span class="filter_filler"> or </span><span class="filter_mobile">long-press</span> an item in the Table of Contents and select <span class="filter_desktop">"Copy Link Location"</span><span class="filter_filler"> or </span><span class="filter_mobile">"Copy Link"</span> to copy a link to that part of the page. However, some pages have headings or other elements identified in the source code by a specific ID, but they do not provide an easy way (like a table of contents) to get a link to that ID. This is where <em>Copy URL With Hash</em> comes in; just <span class="filter_desktop">right-click</span><span class="filter_filler"> or </span><span class="filter_mobile">long-press</span> anywhere on a webpage (for example, on a heading), and, if there is a specific ID that represents the element on which you <span class="filter_desktop">right-clicked</span><span class="filter_filler"> or </span><span class="filter_mobile">long-pressed</span>, <em>Copy URL With Hash</em> will add a button to the context menu (labeled "Copy Page URL With Hash") that will copy the page URL to your clipboard with a hash at the end that will take you directly to that element on the page.</p>
