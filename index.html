<h2 id="About">About</h2>
<p>Copy URL With Hash is a Firefox add-on to copy a page's URL with a hash at the end that identifies the location on the page.</p>

<h2 id="HowItWorks">How It Works</h2>
<p>When building a web page, web developers can assign an ID to a specific element on a page. Then, they can use the ID to link directly to that element on the page. For example, Wikipedia pages have a Table of Contents; the links inside the Table of Contents take you to different parts of the same page. When you click on an item in the Table of Contents, the section of the page is identified in the URL by the <code>hash</code> (the part of the URL after the hashtag symbol: <code>#</code>).</p>
<p>Some sites provide an easy way to get a link to a specific part of the page; for example, on Wikipedia, you can right-click an item in the Table of Contents and select "Copy Link Location" to get a link to that part of the page. However, some pages have headings or other elements identified in the source code by a specific ID, but they do not provide an easy way to get a link to that ID. This is where Copy URL With Hash comes in - just right-click anywhere on a webpage (for example, on a heading), and if there is a specific ID that represents the element on which you right-clicked, Copy URL With Hash will add a button to the context menu (labeled <em>Copy URL With Hash</em>) that will copy the page URL to your clipboard with a hash at the end that will take you directly to that element on the page.</p>
